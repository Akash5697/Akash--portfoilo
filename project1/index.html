            <h1>E-commerce website.</h1>
            <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
            <P>I developed a responsive e-commerce website as part of a personal project, designed to emulate core features of an online retail platform (inspired by Amazon).The frontend of the e-commerce website was designed with a focus on user experience (UX) and clean, intuitive interfaces. The goal was to create a platform that users can easily navigate and use on devices of any size. To achieve this, I implemented a mobile-first design strategy, ensuring seamless performance on both mobile and desktop devices.</P>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <p>>> Responsive Design: Implemented a fully responsive layout using HTML, CSS, and media queries, ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes from mobile to desktop</p>
            <p>>> Extensive use of media queries to adapt the design elements, such as product cards, navigation menus, and buttons, to different viewport sizes .</p>
            <p>>> Sliding Card Window: A dynamic slider that showcases featured products in a visually appealing way.</p>
            <p>>> Clean UI: Simple and modern interface focused on enhancing user experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Navigation and Accessibility:</h3>
            <p>>> A fixed navigation bar with a dropdown menu for smaller screens (using JavaScript for toggling the navigation menu).</p>
            <p>>> Integrated semantic HTML for better accessibility, making the site easier for screen readers to interpret.</p>
            <p>>> Smooth scrolling and anchor links for a more fluid navigation experience.</p>
            <h3> Technologies used </h3>
            <p>>> HTML5: For the basic structure and content of the website.</p>
            <p>>> CSS3: For styling, including layout, colors, and responsive design.</p>
            <p>>> JavaScript: For interactive features like the product slider, dropdown menus, and form validation.</p>
            <p>>> API Integration: For fetching product data dynamically.</p>
            <p>>> Netlify: For deployment, hosting, and managing the website online.</p>
